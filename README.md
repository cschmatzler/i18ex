# Idiom - a modern internationalisation (or localisation?) library

> #### Stability notice {: .warning}
>
> This is currently nowhere near stable. I'm messing around with different APIs, the documentation is incomplete, and some modules are missing proper tests.
> I would appreciate feedback on the current API and notes on where I could improve existing documentation, but please don't use this right now.
